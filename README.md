# PieceOfPi
**estimate Pi with the *Monte Carlo method* and a neotrinkey**

The power of randomness can be harnessed! Estimating the area of a circle by throwing darts at random gives you the means to estimate the value of Pi! 

*Monte Carlo methods are a broad class of computational algorithms that
rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. One of
the basic examples of getting started with the Monte Carlo algorithm
is the estimation of Pi. *                              https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/estimating-value-pi-using-monte-carlo/
